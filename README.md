Glific is an app to mainly automate conversation flows for NGOs. My project was the internal dashboard, which helped NGOs summarize and visualize their impact

-- Built a Glific API to edit approved templates
-- Added charts and tables to help NGOs visualize their impact and data
-- Realized the need for and took initiative to convert the charts to a new library 'ContEx', optimizing the backend
-- Developed a feature to export chart data in the CSV format
-- Developed functionality to filter charts for particular date ranges.
